## [pixell_transaction_report.py]

[As a Software Development Manager,

I want to ensure all programs are correct, accurate and use exception handling appropriately,

So that I can be assured of the quality of our software]

## Code Modification 1

- Added error handling when the data file is not within the application directory.

## Code Modification 2

[Added data validation to check transaction type and amount, handle invalid records with clear error messages, and gracefully exit if the data file is missing.]
